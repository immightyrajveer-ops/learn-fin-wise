## Abstract

The Finance Learning Platform is a comprehensive web application designed to democratize financial education by providing accessible, interactive learning resources. In an era where financial literacy is crucial but often inadequately addressed in traditional education systems, this platform bridges the gap by offering structured learning modules, real-time market news, and AI-powered assistance.

The application leverages modern web technologies including React for a responsive user interface, TypeScript for type-safe development, and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling. The backend infrastructure utilizes Lovable Cloud (built on Supabase) for robust data management, user authentication, and serverless edge functions.

Key features include curated video-based learning modules covering Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), stock trading, and personal finance management; an intelligent chatbot powered by advanced AI models for personalized financial guidance; and a real-time news aggregator that keeps users informed about market developments across stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies.

The platform addresses the critical need for accessible financial education, targeting students, young professionals, and anyone seeking to improve their financial literacy. By combining educational content with real-time information and AI assistance, the application provides a holistic learning environment that adapts to individual user needs.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a modular, component-based architecture:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms)
│   └── Navbar.tsx       # Navigation component
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.tsx         # Landing page
│   ├── Learn.tsx        # Learning modules listing
│   ├── Module.tsx       # Individual module view
│   ├── Chatbot.tsx      # AI chatbot interface
│   ├── FinanceNews.tsx  # News aggregator
│   └── Auth.tsx         # Authentication pages
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # Utility functions
└── integrations/
    └── supabase/        # Supabase client configuration
```

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **Component Composition**: Small, reusable components composed into complex UIs

- `profiles`: User profile information (linked to auth.users)

**Edge Functions:**
1. **fetch-finance-news**: Serverless function that fetches financial news from NewsAPI based on category (stocks, mutual funds, crypto)
2. **chat-finance**: AI-powered chatbot endpoint that processes user queries and returns intelligent responses using Lovable AI

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- JWT-based authentication
